<h1>
    Review
</h1>

<h2>
    Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed â€“ in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
</h2>
<p>
    The Visual Studio Code is very useful in creating websites with different IT languages such as Python, HTML and CSS. Ensuring to have the lastest version however is necessary as different versions of it in the same team could create problems with sharing code back and forth. Trello is useful especially in larger and more lengthy projects as it helps keep in track the tasks that need to be doing. 
</p>

<h2>
    Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello 
</h2>
<p>
    The use of Visual Studio Code is absolutely necessary and vital in creating wesbsites. The system was quite easy to use especially with tutorials for beginners found everywhere online. Trello was useful, however it did take up some time which I think is inappropriate for smaller projects such as the creation of a basic website. Slack and Zoom were very useful in the communication process between team members and project manager. It helps keep everyone updated and it is easier to do video calls for everyone to have the same information simultaneously.
</p>

<h2>
    Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project 
</h2>
<p>
    The website created is in its very basic form considering the amount of time bestowed upon us. However, it has provided the knowledge and systematic approach in which would enable for future changes and upgrades. 
</p>

<h2>
    Describe further improvements you can make to your project 
</h2>
<p>
    Given more time, the website created could do with more planning in terms of the design and content itself. Possibly more focus on detail and how the website could have better functions overall.
</p>

<h2>
    Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose 
</h2>
<p>
    So far, the website contains the basic information required. However, there is always room for improvement. With the time restrictions, this website is able to meet the minimum requirements of the project.
</p>

<h2>
    Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency
</h2>
<p>
    Using software tools like Visual Studio Code has some benfits when it comes to productivity and efficiency. It is easy to use and there are a lot of tutorials online that could help for beginners. There are also some attachments on Visual Studio Code that could prove to be useful such as when manually saving the content in order to update the data, there is an attachment that could be downlaoded in order to automatically save changes to the content of the code.<br>
    <br>
    Some of the drawbacks that could be encountered when using this software could be the case sensitivity as well as being aware of spaces, correct functions and spelling.
</p>

<h2>
    Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
</h2>
<p>
    One of the important factors that could affect productivity and efficiency is planning. In order to follow through and be efficient, planning is vital in identifying what the projected outcome would be, the tasks at hand to achieve those outcomes, and following through with the tasks. Without the planning part of the project, it is hard to create continuity and efficiency.<br>
    <br>
    Tools such as Repl.it would have been useful and save time in the long run when there is more than one member doing the coding. This collaborative browser allows all members to simultaneously see and edit the code. This tool was not used but would have proven to be very useful once incorporated in the system tools used for the creation of the website.
</p>

<h2>
    Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects
</h2>
<p>
    It seems easier to approach and plan for the project at hand once all the content  has been created. This means that answering the essay questions first in order to know what goes on the website would make it more efficient especially with the designing of the website as once the contents are uploaded, one can then identify which design would suit the text involved.<br>
    <br>
    Visiting websites that help with the basic coding helps in terms of allowing one to proceed through an obstacle. There are videos and texts for free online and although it does use up time, it also solves the problems that one could encounter in terms of coding. GitHub is also useful for this since there are others' examples of work which one can compare their own work to for reference.
</p>

<h2>
    Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
</h2>
<p>
    When it comes to testing digital solutions, the approach taken should be to go to the link and see if the function added is doing as it is intended to do. This would involve a lot of refreshing and trial and error. Visually checking for faults and errors throughout the website are necessary as well as troubleshooting and debugging in the actual code. Being able to spot differences is necessary at this stage as a simple unnecessary indent or space could possibly affect the functions applied.
