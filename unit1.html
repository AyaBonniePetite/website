<h2>
    Importance of IT in modern businesses
</h2>

<p>
    Information technology has had cataclysmic effects on innovation. It has brought a lot of advantages to which most businesses nowadays have benefited from. These include creations of smarter apps, improving data storage and analysis, faster processing rates and a a wider range of audience in information distribution. The use of information technology has allowed modern entrepreneurs to gain access to tools that could solve complex problems, lead to better decision-making and improve all aspects of their business. Communication is so much easier with live chats and video-conferences. Customers can now have instant customer support through different modes of modern communication such as through their mobile phones, email, webinars and so on. As for the management of businesses, some improvements have been made to data management systems, management information systems and inventory management systems. In terms of data, businesses can now store large amounts of data without taking up a room full of paper. This also helps reduce the amount carbon footprints made by going through monstrous amounts of paper and other resources. Management information systems are now making it easier for tracking sales, expenses and staff productivity. Inventory management systems allow businesses to track live numbers for stock and sales to help with managing inventory while also saving manpower and the tedious counting which could also be inaccurate due to human error. In conlusion, there is a lot of importance of Information Technology to modern businesses and to driving innovation.

    Methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects
</h2>

<p>
    There are several methods, skills and resources needed to manage and complete digital projects successfuly. Some of the methods of creating digital projects include handling schedules, scheduling resources and giving directions for other team members, coordinating different project timetables and performing quality assessments. These are just some of the methods needed for digital projects. In order to efficiently perform the methods, an information technologist must have certain skills.These include but are not limited to writing and editing skills, report preparation and analysis, being detail-oriented, project management strategy, adaptability, ability to use content management systems and interpersonal interaction with team members, clients and managers. There will also be some vital resources needed to complete these projects. Some examples of resources that have proved to be useful are Trello, Slack, Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
</p>

<h2>
    Planning website and carrying out tasks using IT
</h2>

<p>
    In order to create a website, there would need to be a step-by-step plan and break down of the project into smaller and manageable sections. In this case, Trello is very useful as it can help arrange the tasks into lists and seperate what needs to be done, what is currently being done, and what needs to be doing. The initial planning process involves drafting agendas, creating content strategy, managing the project scope, planning the structure of the website in html and deciding on the design of the website.
</p>

<h2>
    Risks that might impact digital projects
</h2>

<p>
    There are a lot of risks that could impact the success of digital projects. Most of the times these risks are unexpected and unplanned for. One of the main culprits of an unsuccessful digital project could be the lack of planning. Being unprepared for the task at hand as well as preparing for foreseeable risks help manage and minimise the negative impact on the project. Another risk could be if there are unknown softwares/technology which members are not familiar with. It could take time for members to train with new softwares and other products. Another factor that could impact digital projects and which is often overlooked when it comes to asessing risks, is human behaviour. The dynamics of the team as well as leadership could greatly affect the outcome of the project as team members would need to work together effectively. The leadership also affects the team's motivation and cooperation which is vital.

<h2>
    Selecting and using IT systems and software
</h2>

<p>
    Choosing the right IT systems and software would be directly relevant to the project requirements and compatibility. First, the goals for the project need to be identified in order to be able to evaluate what IT system or software would be most effective. This all depends on what needs to be done for the project and the demands of the clients.
</p>

<h2>
    Analysis on chosen technologies
</h2>


<p>
    Some of the technologies I have used in order to create the website include Visual Code Studio, Trello, Git and Github, Slack and Zoom. Slack and Zoom are useful tools to keep communication with the team and the project manager. Trello is useful when approaching the KanBan method in which all members of the team know which tasks need to be doing, are being done, and have been finished. GitHub ensures the codes version control and allows for discovery of the website and seeing the live version of the website.

<h2>
