    Coding allows for free expression and problem solving. One can ideally be able to create a website with the help of their imagination using the programming languages available. It would also require a lot of problem solving to ensure the website operates the way the creator wants it. These skills are also useful and applicable in all aspects of life. Coding provides the opportunity for job opportunities at the comfort of one's home with the flexibility of creating one's own schedule. This allows for more time to focus on life passions and hobbies as well as being financially self-reliant. Most of the work coders do involve creation of websites, applications, and systems. Also problem-solving to debug, and improve current products. It can be argued that coding improves focus as the tasks require sustained and concentrated effort which when practiced can lead to enahnced focus. Coding can therefore better one's life whether done casually or professionally.
