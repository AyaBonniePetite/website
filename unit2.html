    Describing the content and layout for each page
   </h2>
   
   <p>
    There are 4 pages to this website. This website contains contents that highlight the skills and knowledge of Information Technology acquired necessary for being an independent technical consultant. The index page includes personal and contact information. Unit 1's contents involve the planning, selecting and using the appropriate IT systems and software to meet the needs in creating a website. Unit 1 - Review page includes both Unit 1 outcomes 2 and 3. This page is about analysing the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that the creation of the website and the individual tasks are successful. Unit 2 talks about the content, layout and structure of the webpage. All the pages of this website have a basic background image with a blue/grey colour scheme to produce a cool and calming effect. The navigation bar includes hyperlinks to access the different pages of the website. This was done in a way that the navigation bar does not include a hyperlink to the current page it is on.

    Describing the copyright and other constraints affecting the website
   </h2>

   <p>
    There are copyright and other constraints that could affect the website. There are laws that prohibit publishing other's intellectual property. The best way to operate is to assume that all online work is protected by copyright or trademark. This way, the first step is to acquire permission from the original author of the content and also provide a link to the original content. A website needs to be free of unauthorized content. Hence, removal of infringing material on the website is necessary. It may find the owner of the website containing unauthorized content to be liable and pay for damages. Copyright protection applies to all original content no matter who created it. Permission for publication of content is always required in terms of reproduction, display and distribution of said work. The exception in this case is content or images from royalty-free public domains such as Pexels and Free Images.

   <h2>
    Describing access issues that need taking into account - Describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them
   </h2>
  
   <p>
    Web accessibility is when websites are developed and designed to allow people with disabilities to navigate through the website with ease. This would mean that people with disabilities may be able to precieve, understand and interact with the webpage. It would have to encompass disabilities that affect: auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual capabilities. A website being accessible is essential to provide equal access and equal opportunities to people of different capabilities. Accessibility of the website could also affect older people, people in rural areas and developing countries. The most efficient way of incorporating accessibility to one's website is from the  very beginning in order to not double the duration of the task by going back and repurposing the content to be accessible.

   <h2>
    Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites
   </h2>
  
   <p>
    The most common file types for websites are HTML and CSS. Logos and other images that go within the website usually have the file formats including JPEG(Joint Photographic Experts Group), PNG(Portable Network  Graphic), GIF(Graphics Interchange Format) and SVG(Scalable Vector Graphics). There are so many other different file types but on websites, these four are the most common and appropriate. JPEG and PNG are known to be used for logo and webpage images. For animated images, GIF is the file type commonly used. These are small animations with no audio that plays in a loop. This format can be used to add small animations to the website. For uploading documents in a website. It is recommended to keep the actual document. Else, convert it into a PDF(Portable Document Format) to ensure that all pages of the document are in one file and are unalterable.
